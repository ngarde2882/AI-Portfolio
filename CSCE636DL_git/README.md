# CSCE 6363: Deep Learning

This folder contains deep learning experiments and homeworks with PyTorch and TensorFlow. The curriculum covered core neural network architectures for image, sequence, and structured data.

## Covered Topics

- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformers and attention mechanisms
- Loss functions, backpropagation, training best practices

Assignments include both code implementations and Jupyter notebooks.
