# Rocket League Reinforcement Learning Agent

This project is an early-stage reinforcement learning agent designed to play Rocket League using the RLGym framework. The long-term goal is to train a capable teammate agent through curriculum learning, replay-based observation, and competitive self-play.

## Objectives

- Simulate Rocket League training using RLGym and Carball
- Train an agent using PPO and curriculum-based reward shaping
- Develop modular environments and reward functions for skill-specific training (e.g., shooting, passing)

## Current Progress

- Environment setup with RLGym
- Initial PPO training loop scaffolded
- Experimentation with replay parsing and feature extraction

## Planned Work (Fall 2025)

- Refine training pipeline and curriculum
- Implement replay-based offline learning
- Develop teammate-compatible behavior models

> *Development is temporarily paused due to hardware limitations. Occasional code refactoring and planning may continue during summer 2025.*
