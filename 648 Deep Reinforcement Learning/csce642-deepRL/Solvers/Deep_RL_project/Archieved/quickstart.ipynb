This method, defined as `choose_move(self, battle: Battle) -> str`, requires a `Battle` object as input, representing the current game state, and outputs a move order as a string. This move order must adhere to the [showdown protocol](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/SIM-PROTOCOL.md) format. The `poke-env` library provides the `create_order` method to assist in formatting move orders directly from `Pokemon` and `Move` objects.\n",

    "The `battle` parameter, a `Battle` object, encapsulates the agent's current knowledge of the game state. It provides various properties for easy access to game details, such as `active_pokemon`, `available_moves`, `available_switches`, `opponent_active_pokemon`, `opponent_team`, and `team`.\n",
