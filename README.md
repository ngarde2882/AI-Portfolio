# AI Portfolio

This repository collects AI and machine learning projects from my graduate coursework and personal research at Texas A&M University. It includes hands-on implementations of core ML algorithms, reinforcement learning agents, deep learning architectures, and conceptual foundations in artificial intelligence.

Most projects are class-based, and one folder includes an early-stage reinforcement learning agent for Rocket League. Development is paused for the summer due to hardware limitations but will resume in the fall.
