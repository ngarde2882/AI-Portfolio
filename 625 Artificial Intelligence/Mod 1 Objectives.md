Explain
    different definitions of intelligence
        thinking like humans
            difficult to tell
        acting like humans
            good, but humans do stupid things. we do not want AI to do stupid things
        thinking rationally
            again difficult to tell
        acting rationally - react to environment
        "We define AI as the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions" - Russell&Norvig
    broad scope of AI
        problem-solving
        reasoning
        theorem proving
        learning
        planning
        knowledge representation
        perception and robotics
        agents
        deep learning
        AI ethics
Differentiate
    concepts of strong vs weak AI
        strong AI
            build a machine capable of thought, consiousness and emotions
                equalling that of humans
            humans are no more than elaborate computers
            the model IS the mind
        weak AI
            develop theories of human and animal intelligence
                test theories by building working models
                programs/robots
            working models are tools to aid in understanding
            does not claim that machines are capable of thought, consciousness, and emotions
    their respective challenges
        strong
            difficult to determine concious intelligence
            other minds problem in philosophy
                I know I am caonscious, but I cannot tell whether anyone else is
        weak
            utility is limited by the goal
            difficult to achieve general usefulness as in true intelligence
Discuss
    role of philosophy
        philosophy of mind
        mind-body problem: what is the connection between the mind (thought, belief, pain, sense, emotion) and the physical realm (matter, atom, neurons)
    articulate concepts of:
        dualism - mind and body are separate entities
        monism - only mind or body exists, not both
            idealism - all things are mental
            materialism - all things are material
        epiphenominalism - mental phenomena are side-effects of physical change in the brain (no causal power)
Recognize
    importance of AI ethics and the issues it focuses on
        safety, fairness, privacy, promoting collaboration, transparency, limiting harmful use
Explain
    contribution of academic disciplines to AI
        mathematics
            algorithms, logic, completeness of arithmetic axioms, Goedel's incompleteness theorem (inability to prove), Turing's halting problem (will an algorithm complete) and conceptualization of computing machines with intelligence
        psycology
            behaviorism - stimulus-response and conditioning
            allowed psych as a science, but denied internal workings of the brain
            functionalism - internal representations and processes (independant to behaviorism)
            by definition allows machine a mind
            perceptual psych - sensory (sight, audio, touch)
            cognitive psych - information processing, very related to AI
        linguistics
            LLM -> ChatGPT
        cognitive science
            shares many basic assumptions with AI
            studies perception and cognition
        neuroscience
Trace
    history of AI 1940s->present day
        1943: McCulloch and Pitts invented neural networks
        1956: Newell and Simon develop "The Logic Theorist"
              Darthoth workshop on AI, where the term 'AI' was born
        1958: Rosenblatt invented perceptrons, first trainable NN
        1959: general problem solvers
        1960: Widrow and Hoff developed ADELINE, gradient descent NN
        1956-62: McCarthy invented AI programming language LISP
        1964: STUDENT (algebra problem solver)
        1968: ANALOGY (analogy problem solver)
        1969: Minsky and Papert publish limitations of perceptron
        1970s: mostly hard-coded AI (ELIZA, genetic algorithms, knowlege based systems)
        1976: Newell and Simon propose physical system hypothesis
        1980s: symbolic logic-based AI (Prolog, neocognitron NN, conv NN, back prop)
        1990s: learning from data (ML, probabalistic: Bayesian and Hidden Markov Models) and support vector machines (supervisedML)
        2000-10s: statistical natural language processing
                  learning from unstructured data
                  IBM Watson (crushes jeopardy contestants)
                  human based compputation (recaptcha, amazon mechanical turk)
        2010s: age of DL
               computer vision - conv NN
               speech - recurrent NN
               NLP - recurrent NN -> transformers
               DRL - games and automated driving
        AGI - NNs need improvement, some argue we need a hybrid of NN and symbolic AI
