# CSCE 633: Machine Learning

This folder includes assignments and exploratory notebooks from a graduate-level machine learning course. Projects span a variety of ML techniques and datasets, including a research-inspired final project.

## Highlights

- Discussion notebooks for core concepts: trees, SVMs, NNs, etc.
- Homework assignments using sklearn and PyTorch on datasets like MNIST and Kaggle sets
- **Final Project**: Used CGM, Viome, and demographic data to predict food intake (carbs, protein, etc.), inspired by research from course instructor
