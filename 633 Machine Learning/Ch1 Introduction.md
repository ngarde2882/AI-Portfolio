prediction
    wage dataset to predict an employee's wage
grouping
    stock market dataset to predict S&P movement up or down
clustering
    gene expression dataset to group (cluster) based on observed characteristics

n represents the number of distinct data points, or observations, in our sample
p denotes the number of variables that are available for use in making predictions
let xij represent the value of the jth variable for the ith observation, where i = 1, 2,...,n and j = 1, 2,...,p

    x11 x12 ... x1p
    x21 x22 ... x2p
X = ... ... ... ...
    xn1 xn2 ... xnp

when we want data of a single point we need to take the row xi
     xi1
xi = ...
     xip

when we want data of a single variable (for all points) we take the column xj
     x1j
xj = ...
     xnj
